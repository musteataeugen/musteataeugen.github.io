<h2 id="clasa1">Clasa 1</h2>
<p>For this week's homework assignment, create a website to show off your new skills.</p>
<h3>Core HTML5 skills you should be able to include on your page(s):</h3>
<ol>
   <li>A <i>nav</i> bar with a few links that either navigate to other pages or act as anchor tags.</li>
   <li>A <i>heading</i> to signal something important or declare a new section/paragraph.</li>
   <li>A couple <i>paragraphs</i> describing the amazing things you want to share. Remember to use emphasis on key words!</li>
   <li>A list of key things to know about something in your paragraph. Why not do an ordered list and unordered list?</li>
   <li>An image of something relevant and visually appealing. You can store your image as an asset in your project folder or link back to the source on the web. The link should be clickable, but the image doesn't need to be.</li>
   <li>A footer at the bottom of the page declaring your copyright on such a wonderful write-up, and make sure you use the copyright symbol!</li>
   <li>Your page should validate in this at this link <a href="#">W3 Validator.</a></li>
   <li>Keep your code <a href="#"> readabable and maintanable</a> for your future self and future contributors.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can always check the <a href="#"> Class 1 slides</a>for help.</p>
